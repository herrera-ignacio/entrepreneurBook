 #### Entrepreneurs are everywhere

Human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

 #### Entrepreneurship is management

A startup is an institution, not just a product, and so it requires a new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extrem uncertainty.

 #### Validated Learning

Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money or even serve customers. They exist to _learn_ how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments.

 #### Build - Measure - Lean

Fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whatever to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop.


 #### Innovation accounting

To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups, and people who hold them accountable.
# Why Startups Fail?
First problem is the __allure of a good plan, a solid strategy and thorough market research__. Startups operate with too much uncertainty, do not yet know who their customer is or what their product should be. Planning and forecasting are only accurate based on a long, stable, operating history and a relatively static environment. Startups have neither.

Second problem is that __after seeing traditional management fail to solve this problem, some entrepreneurs have adopted the "Just Do It" school of startups, which believes that if management is the problem, chaois is the answer.

It may seem counterintuitive to think that something as disruptive, innovative, and chaotic as a startup can be managed, or to be accurate, _must_ be managed.
